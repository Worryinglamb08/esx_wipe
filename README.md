# esx_wipe
esx_wipe is a resource which allows you to delete a player from all the tables in BDD with a usable item

Add it to your resource file

Add the SQL file to your BDD

Add 'start esx_wipe' in your .cfg

The name of the item has this give and {wipe}

As all BDDs are not all the same, you may need to adjust it for your own (add or remove tables)
